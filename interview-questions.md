# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is repeating something a set amount of times. For JavaScript, iteration is used to iterate over a loop 'x' amount of times.

  Researched answer: Iteration allows for programs to perform repetitve tasks. They allow you excute a function x amount of times as well as for arrays and other loops such as while loops.



2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The .map() method takes value, index, and the array. The index and array are optional.

  Researched answer: The map method does take in the three values stated, however MDN calls the value option an element but its just a variable so it does not matter what it is called.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Destructuring allows the user to get the values from an array or object and store them in variables.

  Researched answer: Destructuring allows you or makes it possible to unpack values and assign them into distinct variables.



4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer: The class is like a blueprint for an object. They are more specific than objects because they control the object.

  Researched answer: JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance so there are not any classes because everything is techincally an object. (still confused about this)



5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: A user would use super() to get access to the functions from a parent object.

  Researched answer: A super() is used to get access to the parents object. It must be the first used in the constructor of a child object. In order to use super() a user must extend the parent object.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: no idea.

  Researched answer: interesting concept but it allows a user to use an object, fucntion, or variable before it is assiged but obvisouly it would still have to be assigned below it.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. React: React is a JavaScript library used to help building user interfaces.

2. React lifecycle methods: There are three phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting which react goes through each component when its run.

3. React state: The state is a component of an object that holds information that may change over some time.

4. Component invocation/call: render()

5. DOM Events: DOM stands for Document Object Model, it is the data representation of objects and it allows you change the document structure, style and content
